# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Rules

* The game is played on a grid that is 3x3 squares.
* There are two players. Player one is represented by `X` and player two is represented by `O`.
* Each player takes turns placing their marker in an empty square on the grid.
* The first player to get three marks in a row (up, down, across, diagonally) is the winner.
* The game is also over when all squares on the grid are filled in the case that no player got three in a row.
